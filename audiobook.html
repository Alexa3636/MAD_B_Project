				<h3>Just a bit of background!</h3>
				<p>An audiobook is a type of electronic book that is listened to rather than read in the traditional
				sense. Audiobooks have been around for a long time, even before e-books became available. 
				Its history can be traced back to Thomas Edison's invention of the phonograph in 1877. 
				Recorded books were initially created to offer an alternative reading format for people who have 
				difficulty reading printed books due to poor eyesight, illiteracy, or dyslexia.</p>
				<img src="images/IMG03_INPpicture_AB.png" alt="Insomnia design picture drifting off">
				<p>However, with the rise of digital media, audiobooks are no longer considered as a by-product of 
				printed books. If the sales figures for the printed book are significant, the audiobook is often 
				recorded after the book has been printed.</p>
				
				<p>Today, the audiobook market has become so big that audiobooks are now published simultaneously 
				with both the printed and the e-book versions.<br> This creates flexibility in reading choices 
				from the moment of publication. Moreover, the digital audiobook appeals to a much broader group 
				of consumers than before, making it accessible to everyone.</p>
				
				<h3><br>Our bedtime stories in a modern wrapping</h3>
				<p>Using audiobooks as a sleep aid may unconsciously evoke memories and recretae the feeling of our 
				childhood bedtime stories, providing a calming atmosphere that prepares us mentally and physically 
				for sleep. </p>
				<p>The comforting feeling of snuggling up with parents, grandparents, caregivers, or siblings for an 
				adventure or story time before drifting off to sleep is an ideal image that every child should 
				experience.</p>
				<p><center><b><i>“When we give our children a rhythmic, not regimented, bedtime routine they can feel safe:
				bathing, brushing teeth, jim-jams, story and lights out… allows the child to enter sleep 
				with ease and relaxation.”</i></b></center></p>
				<h3>The Voice</h3>
				<p>The narrator's voice can play a crucial role in helping listeners relax while listening to an 
				audiobook. People have different preferences when it comes to finding a calming voice. 
				Publishers also make an effort to match the voice with the story's tone, atmosphere, and style. 
				Sam Halstead, the editorial director for Penguin Random House Audio, described as:</p>
				<p><center><b><i>"First and foremost, we want somebody with a great voice that will draw listeners in. 
				Recording audiobooks isn’t an easy business though, so aside from a great voice we also need an 
				actor who is prepared and willing to put the work in to prepare ahead of time and really get into 
				the nuts and bolts of the book. They’ll be living with every word of the text, often for many days 
				in studio, so need a good understanding of the text to be able to comfortably perform the words in 
				the style the book most needs, and the commitment to maintain consistency in that performance over
				many hours.”</i></b></center></p>

				<h3><br>How could Audiobooks help to handle insomnia?</h3>
				<p>Audiobooks could have a significant impact on our mental health. They can help improve our moods 
				and disrupt negative thinking patterns. According to Psychology Today, listening to someone else 
				read can replace negative thoughts with something else, especially for those prone to anxiety and 
				depression. </p>
				<p>Moreover, audiobooks help relax our eyes, which is crucial for people who spend most of their time
				looking at digital screens. Studies show that over seven hours of screen time daily can lead to 
				blurred vision, eye strain, and even long-term vision problems such as near-sightedness. 
				Social media use has also been linked to feelings of loneliness and depression. 
				Therefore, listening to an audiobook can be a great way to put down the phone and unwind.</p>
				<p>Additionally, listening to audiobooks can help improve sleep quality. The blue light from screens 
				disrupts our circadian rhythm, making it difficult to fall asleep at night. Audiobooks allow our 
				eyes and mind to relax, which can lead to a good night's sleep.</p>
				<p>Finally, audiobooks can transport listeners to another world, making them a powerful tool for 
				escaping daily worries and captivating the imagination. By creating a whole world inside and 
				outside ourselfs, audiobooks allow us to tap into the wonder of storytelling.</p>
