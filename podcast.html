				<h3>Just a bit of background!</h3>
				<p>Podcasting was officially developed in 2004 by former MTV video jockey Adam Curry and software 
				developer Dave Winer. They created a program called iPodder, which allowed them to download Internet 
				radio broadcasts to their iPods. Initially, podcasts were like on-demand radio shows, available in 
				episodes that listeners could download online. Therefore, in the beginning, podcasting was a niche form of 
				"audio blogging" or "online radio" for early adopters.</p>
				<img src="images/IMG03_INPpicture_POD.jpg" alt="Podcast design picture podcast setup">
				<p>The term "podcasting" was coined by journalist Ben Hammersly in a 2004 newspaper article for The 
				Guardian. Hammersley predicted a potential boom in amateur radio due to the popularity of blogging, 
				inexpensive production software, and the widespread use of MP3 players. He considered various names, 
				including "Audioblogging" and "GuerillaMedia," before settling on "Podcasting." </p>
			
				<p>Podcasting has become a multi-billion dollar industry that spans a wide range of topics and 
				interests. Also, they have become a cultural phenomenon and have evolved into a diverse medium, 
				with many podcasters adding video to their content as well.</p>
				<h3><br>Let's focus on sleeping podcasts!</h3>
				<p>Listening to podcasts can help you fall asleep. They relax you before bed and prevent anxious 
				rumination that can delay sleep. Moreover, the act of listening to a podcast can help you create 
				a bedtime routine that could work as a signal to the body that it is time for the sleeping process.</p>
				<p>Experts suggest that although listening to podcasts to help with sleeping is not harmful, 
				it's recommended to be cautious about it and avoid overdoing it, as noises can distract the brain 
				from drifting off or even interrupt the sleeping process. Additionally, the stories presented in 
				the podcasts could boost brain activity, resulting in resting inefficiently, which causes tiredness 
				upon awakening.</p>
				<p>Recently, a new genre of podcasts has emerged, known as 'sleeping podcasts '. These podcasts are 
				specifically designed to aid sleep, often featuring guided meditation techniques or presenting 
				soothing stories in a calm, monotone voice. They offer a shorter listening time compared to audiobooks, 
				making them a convenient option for bedtime. These podcasts are widely available across various 
				applications, providing a diverse range of content for sleep assistance. As Rachel Finn puts it:</p>
				<p><center><b><i>"The pleasant, low-level conversations are surprisingly soothing, as though listening to people 
				talk about nothing is a welcome respite from the millions of things running through my head on a 
				daily basis. Before I know it, my cyclical and sometimes anxious thoughts about work deadlines, 
				administrative life tasks, and “what am I doing with my life?!” panic breaks up and drifts away. 
				I usually fall asleep with the chatter playing in the background and wake up in the morning with 
				my headphones tangled somewhere under my duvet." </i></b></center></p>
				<h3><br> So, how it is done and what is out there?</h3>
				<p>There are now several sleep podcasts available that are designed to help you sleep better. 
				One of the most popular and long-running ones is Sleep With Me, which was launched by its host, 
				Drew Ackerman, in 2013.</p>
				<p>Because Ackerman was one of the first to create a sleep podcast, he learned through trial and 
				error what works best for helping listeners fall asleep. For example, he avoids talking about things 
				that might make people anxious or scared, such as spiders, snakes, lizards, politics, money, health, 
				and flying. Instead, he tells meandering, low-stakes stories that can be followed along with and 
				have a calming effect on listeners. Despite the lack of exciting content, Sleep With Me has amassed 
				a large following, with over 70,000 regular listeners as of 2016, according to publicly available 
				stats. Ackerman describes the process as:</p>
				<p><center><b><i>“I’m trying to maintain just enough interest so that people don’t go back to 
				whatever is running in their head, whether it’s work or personal stuff,” Ackerman said, naming the 
				two biggest things that keep me and countless other adults awake at night. It’s essentially artful 
				distraction; mimicking the cadence of your most boring high school teacher—only now, you’re 
				encouraged to fall asleep during the lecture."</i></b></center></p>
